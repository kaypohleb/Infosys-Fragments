# App Demo

**Static part of UI \(in Activity layout\):**

**on screen during entire Activity lifecycle** 

The [FragmentExample1](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-advanced/tree/master/FragmentExample1) app displays an image and the title and text of a magazine article. It also shows a `Fragment` that enables users to provide feedback for the article. In this case the feedback is very simple: just "Yes" or "No" to the question "Like the article?" Depending on whether the user gives positive or negative feedback, the app displays an appropriate response.

The `Fragment` is skeletal, but it demonstrates how to create a `Fragment` to use in multiple places in your app's UI.

1. Statically adding `Fragment`
